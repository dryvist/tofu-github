    Enforcement mode for the org-wide markdown-lint ruleset.

    Start at "evaluate" (dry-run): the ruleset reports results in the org
    Rulesets > Insights tab WITHOUT blocking any merges. This lets the rule roll
    out across every repo safely before the whole org's markdown is compliant.
    Flip to "active" once Insights shows the fleet is green.

    One of: disabled, evaluate, active.
